# PvZ: Rogue Garden

Welcome to **PvZ: Rogue Garden**, a Plants vs Zombies Unity fan game that ventures into the rogue-like. Drawing inspiration from various games in the Plants vs Zombies franchise, this project is a creative fusion, heavily rooted in the classic PvZ, while embracing elements from PvZ 2, Heroes, GW, GW2, BfN, Adventures, and even contributions from fellow fan games.

## Project Overview

🌱 **Concept:**
PvZ: Rogue Garden is a unique blend of the familiar and the new, crafting an exciting rogue-like experience that pays homage to the beloved Plants vs Zombies universe.

## Getting Started

🎮 **No Prior Experience Needed:**
This project is a personal journey into the realms of game design and programming.

⚠️ **Learning Journey:**
I want to be transparent—this project is a learning adventure for me. I have minimal experience in game design, programming (outside of HTML, Javascript, and Java basics), and art. With your support and collaboration, we'll navigate through the challenges, learn, and grow together.
