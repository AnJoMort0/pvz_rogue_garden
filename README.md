# PvZ: Rogue Garden

Welcome to **PvZ: Rogue Garden**, a Plants vs Zombies Unity fan game that ventures into the rogue-like. Drawing inspiration from various games in the Plants vs Zombies franchise, this project is a creative fusion, heavily rooted in the classic PvZ, while embracing elements from PvZ 2, Heroes, GW, GW2, BfN, Adventures, and even contributions from fellow fan games.

## Project Overview

🌱 **Concept:**
PvZ: Rogue Garden is a unique blend of the familiar and the new, crafting an exciting rogue-like experience that pays homage to the beloved Plants vs Zombies universe.
In this innovative take, plants have evolutions, offering strategic choices for players. For instance, a Repeater can evolve into either a Threepeater or a Gatling Pea, allowing for diverse and personalized gameplay. Explore place-on fusions to create new plant variants. For instance, combining an Iceberg Lettuce with a Peashooter results in a chilling Snow Pea. Unleash your creativity and discover synergies between different plant species. Finally, channelling the spirit of the classic Plants vs Zombies, the game features upgrades reminiscent of PvZ1, encouraging players to experiment with combinations. Imagine combining two plants to create a formidable force, akin to the mighty Cob Cannon.

## Getting Started

🎮 **No Prior Experience:**
This project is a personal journey into the realms of game design and programming. As a novice with limited experience in Unity and C#, I'll be relying on tutorials and leveraging ChatGPT to bring this idea to life. If you're passionate about game development or just intrigued by the concept, consider joining the project!

## Disclaimer

⚠️ **Learning Journey:**
I want to be transparent—this project is a learning adventure for me. I have minimal experience in game design, programming (outside of HTML, Javascript, and Java basics), and art. With your support and collaboration, we'll navigate through the challenges, learn, and grow together.

¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ **I Don't Know What I'm Doing:**
All files I've used for the game development are on this page, constantly updated, including the Unity project. I don't even know if anyone can do anything with it. Anyway ⚠️ the PackageCache file under Library is missing because its files are too large for GitHub, so if you copy the whole repository, you may need to generate your own.

## Join the Adventure!
