//This is the full list of plants, which will have an almanac in the game. There will be adjustements with play-testing and many of these will take a long to actually join the game. Any ideas are welcome as long as you follow the guidelines according to the comented template. You are welcome to propose changes and give feedback.

    //template_plant
        string despcription = "";   //basic description of the plant (if available, you can easily take it straight from its game of origin)
        double cost = 25;           //sun cost of the plant. The game works on a 25 sun basis
        double hp = 6;              //hit points (hp) are counted in peas. Yes, even the plants'. Note: A regular plant has 6 hp
        double dmg = 1;             //damage (dmg) is counted in peas
        double aps = 1;             //aps stands for attacks per second, aka how fast the plant attacks
        string special = "";        //if relevant, add a precise description of the ability/ies (this won't   show up in the actual almanac, it is instead used for coding), if not remove this line.
        string almanac = "";        //almanac entry, be it copied from one of the original games or entirely/partially new
        string origin = "";         //game(s) or mod(s) of origin
